## Why I'm writing this guide?

Over 20+ years of working with, leading, mentoring, and hiring developers, I've seen many brilliant hackers. But so often these coding "ninjas" and "wizards" went unnoticed, while much less "rockstar" developers made a splash and rose through the ranks.

It's not magic. And it's not luck.

It's because being a great software developer is not about coding skills. It's about helping your team, product, and company succeed.

Understanding this let me grow to senior, lead, and finally VP. And, along the way, help many other developers advance their careers. But developing the necessary skills and applying them in practice is hard. It took me years of trial and error, of rabbit holes and dead ends.

I want your journey to senior and beyond to go smoother, without wasting so much time as I did.

## Who is this guide for?

In short: everyone.

The same principles helped me advance from junior to senior as well as from lead to VP. They will help you, too, no matter if you are:

* A fresh coding bootcamp graduate, not sure how to kickstart your career.
* A junior, looking to build solid foundation and "level-up" for the first time.
* A mid-level or early senior, with ambitions to become a well-rounded expert.
* A seasoned senior, ready to take your career even further, to staff or management level.
* A staff or principal-level veteran, struggling to keep your skills fresh, stay relevant, and avoid a plateau.
* ...or just curious where do you stand and how complete is your skillset.

No matter what's your next step, this guide will help you get there _faster_.
