## PART 1. Being a professional developer.

If you consider yourself a professional, you're no longer coding just for fun. You're now coding to help your company succeed. And this completely changes the game.

You'll never become a true professional (or, in fact, anything more than a micromanaged code monkey) if you don't understand:

### [📖 Chapter 1. What does it mean to be a professional?](pages/chapter_01.md)

What sets a professional apart from a hobbyist, the difference between passive, active, and proactive mindsets, and the nature of modern software development.

### [📖 Chapter 2. What makes companies successful?](pages/chapter_02.md)

### [📖 Chapter 3. How we, developers, can influence a company's success?](pages/chapter_03.md)

Why you have more leverage than you think, how you can influence different facets of a company's success, and why it's crucial for you to do so.

## PART 2. Advancing your career.

Being a true professional is not enough for getting noticed and promoted. To fast-track your career progression you have to purposefully steer it.

In particular, it's essential for you to know:

Technology is changing too fast to learn everything just once and rely on that knowledge forever. If you're aiming for a successful lifelong career, you'll need to continuously update your skills or even completely reinvent yourself.
