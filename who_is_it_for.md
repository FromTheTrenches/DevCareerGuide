# Who is this guide for?

In short: **`everyone`**.

The same principles helped me advance from junior to senior as well as from lead to VP. They will help you, too, no matter if you are:

* **A fresh coding bootcamp graduate**, not sure how to kickstart your career.
* **A junior**, looking to build a solid foundation and "level up" for the first time.
* **A mid-level or early senior**, with ambitions to become a well-rounded expert.
* **A seasoned senior**, ready to take your career even further, to the staff or management level.
* **A staff or principal-level veteran**, struggling to keep your skills fresh, stay relevant, and avoid a plateau.
* ...or just curious where you stand and how complete is your skillset.

No matter what's your next step, this guide will help you get there _faster_.
